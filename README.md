# Final-Capstone-Project

Introduction and Business Problem:

	While Silicon Valley is considered a desirable place for tech workers to live and work, the cost of living is very high due to the combination of constrained housing supply and high demand. As a result, an increasing number of companies and workers are looking outward at other locations to save money. Companies hope they can save money on office space and workers’ salaries, while workers hope to trade a lower salary for superior housing opportunities. However, it does narrow the recruiting pool for those companies. 
	This study aims to quantify the similarity between neighborhoods across tech hubs in the United States, with a business case of selling the information to companies to aid their recruitment efforts. They can compare the amenities of their home city with those of others, and play up the difference in their favor. Alternately, individuals might access the same database to help them evaluate where they would like to relocate to.
